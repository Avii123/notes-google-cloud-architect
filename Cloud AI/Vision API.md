# Google Cloud Vision API

[Google Cloud Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision/) enables developers to understand the content of an image by encapsulating powerful machine learning models in an easy to use REST API. It quickly classifies images into thousands of categories (e.g., "sailboat", "lion", "Eiffel Tower"), detects individual objects and faces within images, and finds and reads printed words contained within images.

## Features

* Simple RESTful API.
* Object detection and classification.

## When to Use?

* Gain insight from images.
* Detect inappropriate content.
* Analyze sentiment.
* Extract text.
