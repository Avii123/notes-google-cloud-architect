# Google Cloud Architect Notes

This repository contains my notes for studying the Google Cloud Platform to sit the Professional Cloud Architect exam.

* 2017-12-20: I passed the exam and am leaving this repository here for anyone else to use.
* 2020-02-26: Sat the exam again to maintain the certification. My certification didn't expire because of my Google Cloud Trainer certification.

Either fork this repository or raise an issue and I will make you a contributor.

__See the [Change Log](#change-log) below for update details.__

## Recommendations

Use the GitHub code view to locate documents.

I recommend installing [Octotree](https://www.octotree.io/) in [FireFox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/octotree/) ([why FireFox?](https://github.com/DDLSTraining/Engage/blob/master/Internet/Firefox.md)) to help you read the documents online.

Install [Mark Text (Windows)](https://marktext.app/) or [ghostwriter (Linux)](https://github.com/wereturtle/ghostwriter) to read and update the documents.
