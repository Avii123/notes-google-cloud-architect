# Cloud Firestore

Store cloud-native app data at global scale.

## Features


__Security__

Cloud Firestore has built-in security access controls for data and enables simple data validation via a configuration language.

__Datastore mode__

Cloud Firestore supports the Datastore API. You won't need to make any changes to your existing Datastore apps, and you can expect the same performance characteristics and pricing with the added benefit of strong consistency.

__Automatic upgrade__

Your Cloud Datastore databases will be upgraded seamlessly and automatically shortly after the GA release of Cloud Firestore. No code changes required, and no downtime for your app.

__ACID transactions__

Cloud Firestore has support for transactions, so if any of the operations in the transaction fails (and cannot be retried) the whole transaction will fail.

__Multi-region replication__

With automatic multi-region replication and strong consistency, your data is safe and available, even when disasters strike.

__Powerful query engine__

Cloud Firestore allows you to run sophisticated queries against your NoSQL data without any degradation in performance. This gives you more flexibility in the way you structure your data.

__Built for cloud-native applications__

Typical workloads include mobile and web applications, collaborative multi-user applications, IoT asset tracking and real-time analytics, retail product catalogs, communications, social user profiles and activity, and gaming leaderboards.
