# Google Cloud Functions

[Google Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/concepts/overview) is a serverless execution environment for building and connecting cloud services.

With Cloud Functions you write simple, single-purpose functions that are attached to events emitted from your cloud infrastructure and services. Your Cloud Function is triggered when an event being watched is fired. Your code executes in a fully managed environment. There is no need to provision any infrastructure or worry about managing any servers.

## Features

* Execute in a managed Node.js environment.
* Connect and extend cloud services such as Cloud Storage, Cloud Pub/Sub, and more.
